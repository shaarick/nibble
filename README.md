Sample code for discussion

For this interview you are not required to write any code, but we ask that you be prepared to talk about the python
code in this folder.

## The python file

In text_splitter.py you will find a simple class with a single class method. This has been extracted from the Nibble
codebase, and is part of the Nibble bot.  Take a look at the code and try to understand what it does. Experiment with
running it if you like.

## Things to consider

You do not need to write any code or submit anything before your second interview. Instead we will ask you to discuss
the code, including but not limited to such topics as:

  * What does the code do and how does it work?
  * How could the code be improved to be more readable and/or understandable?
  * What limitations does the code currently have?
  * How could the code be simplified, optimised or otherwise improved?
